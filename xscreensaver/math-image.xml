<_description> 
Display a random mathematical image.
See "man math-image" for details.

Sometimes a random image is blank, or just a line across the bottom of
the screen which looks blank.  The code tries to be both random and
interesting but doesn't always succeed.  It also may be a bit slow
sometimes.
