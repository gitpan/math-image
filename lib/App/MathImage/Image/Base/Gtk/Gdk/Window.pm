=head1 NAME

Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window -- draw into a Gdk window

=for test_synopsis my $win

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window;
 my $image = Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window->new (-window => $win);
 $image->line (0,0, 99,99, '#FF00FF');
 $image->rectangle (10,10, 20,15, 'white');

=head1 CLASS HIERARCHY

C<Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window> is a subclass of
C<Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Drawable>,

    Image::Base
      Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Drawable
        Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window> extends C<Image::Base> to draw into Gdk
windows.  There's no file load or save, just drawing operations.

This is a placeholder at the moment, it doesn't add anything to what
C<Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Drawable> does.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

See L<Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Drawable/FUNCTIONS> and
L<Image::Base/FUNCTIONS> for the behaviour inherited from the superclasses.

=over 4

=item C<$image = Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window-E<gt>new (key=E<gt>value,...)>

Create and return a new image object.  C<-window> must be a
C<Gtk2::Gdk::Window> object,

    $image = Image::Base::Gtk2::Gdk::Window->new (-window => $win);

There's nothing to create a new C<Gtk2::Gdk::Window> since there's so many
attributes when creating which seem outside the scope of this C<Image::Base>
wrapper.

=back

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over

=item C<-width> (integer)

=item C<-height> (integer)

The size of the window.  Changing these resizes the window.

=item C<-window> (Gtk2::Gdk::Window object)

The target window.  C<-drawable> and C<-window> access the same attribute.

=back

=head1 FUTURE

It might be possible for colour "None" to mean transparent so drawing it
would make holes in windows per C<< $window->shape_combine_mask >>.  But is
there a shape "Subtract"?  Or how to get the current shape to modify?
