=head1 NAME

App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::PixbufBits -- misc Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf helpers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::PixbufBits;

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over

=item C<< $format = App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::PixbufBits::filename_to_format ($filename) >>

Return the C<Gtk2::Gdk::PixbufFormat> for the given C<$filename> from its
extension.  For example F<foo.png> is PNG format.  If the filename is not
recognised then return C<undef>.

PixbufFormat is new in Gtk 2.2.  Currently C<filename_to_format> throws an
error in Gtk 2.0.x.  Would returning C<undef> be better?  Or some
compatibility fakery?

=item C<< App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::PixbufBits::format_matches_filename ($format, $filename) >>

C<$format> should be a C<Gtk2::Gdk::PixbufFormat> object.  Return true if
one of its extensions matches C<$filename>.  For example JPEG format matches
F<foo.jpg> or F<foo.jpeg>.
