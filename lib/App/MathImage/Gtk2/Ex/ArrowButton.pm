=head1 NAME

App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::ArrowButton -- button with a direction arrow

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::ArrowButton;
 my $ab = App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::ArrowButton->new;

=head1 WIDGET HIERARCHY

C<App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::ArrowButton> is a subclass of C<Gtk2::Button>,

    Gtk2::Widget
      Gtk2::Container
        Gtk2::Bin
          Gtk2::Button
            App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::ArrowButton

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An ArrowButton widget is a C<Gtk2::Button> with a directional arrow drawn in
it.

    +-----------+
    |    +      |
    |    |\     |
    |    | \    |
    |    |  +   |
    |    | /    |
    |    |/     |
    |    +      |
    +-----------+

In the current code it's done simply with a C<Gtk2::Arrow> widget child, but
with various properties and style settings arranged to make it fill the
button, and to avoid the arrow's otherwise hard-coded 15 pixel minimum size.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<< $ab = App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::ArrowButton->new (key=>value,...) >>

Create and return a new ArrowButton object.  Optional key/value pairs set
initial properties per C<< Glib::Object->new >>.

    my $ab = App::MathImage::Gtk2::Ex::ArrowButton->new (arrow_type => 'left');

=back

=head1 PROPERTIES

=over 4

=item C<arrow-type> (C<Gtk2::ArrowType> enum, default C<right>)

The arrow type to show, one of C<up>, C<down>, C<left>, C<right> or C<none>.
C<none> means nothing is shown.  The default is the same as C<Gtk2::Arrow>.

=back

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

C<Gtk2::Arrow> always responds to its C<< $arrow->size_request >> asking for
15x15 pixels.  Most container widgets (including C<Gtk2::Button>) respect
that and the effect is that it can be made bigger if desired, but no smaller
than 15 pixels.  A C<< $arrow->set_size_request(1,1) >> or similar can be
used to reduce it if the container's size is going to be determined
elsewhere and the arrows shouldn't have a minimum.
