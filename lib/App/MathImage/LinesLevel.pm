=head1 NAME

App::MathImage::LinesLevel -- replication level line drawing

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a special kind of "values" which draws lines between the points of
the path through to a selectable replication level, holding the endpoints
fixed.

This is designed for paths like the KochCurve or Flowsnake where the
replication levels turn each line segment into a further shape.

The current code depends on some hard coded setups for the levels of the
various paths, and doesn't work well at all on non-replicating paths.
