# =item C<($str, -underline =E<gt> $pos) = with_underline($str)>
#
# This function is designed for use on a C<-label> or C<-text> argument such
# as
#
#     $menu->command (-label => with_underline("_File"),
#                     -command => ...)
#
# If C<$str> has an underscore like S<"Save _As"> then return 3 values
#
#     "Save As", -underline => 5
#
# so the underscore becomes a C<-underline> position.
# If C<$str> doesn't have an underscore then return C<$str> unchanged.
#
# A literal underscore can be included by doubling it, for example
#
#     "Literal__Underscore"
#     # gives "Literal_Underscore"
#
# Extracting an underline position from a string like this is easier than
# counting characters manually for the C<-underline> argument.  It's also
# easier if translating labels into other languages (C<Locale::TextDomain>
# or similar) since the underline position will be different in a different
# language, or there might be no underline at all.
